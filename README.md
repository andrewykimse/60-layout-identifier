# 60_keyboard_layout_identifier

This is a simple project stemming from the simple classifier shown in course 2 of the fast.ai deep learning course.

The idea for this project is to create a model that is capable of identifying 3 different types of popular 60% keyboard layouts: wkl, hhkb, and standard.

This idea partially stemmed from standard image search engines abilities to identify different types of layouts accurately, and wanting to remediate that.
